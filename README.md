# Bitcoin_ticker_app_using_API
A bitcoin ticker app is a mobile application that allows users to track the current prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in real-time. The app relies on an API, which is a set of programming instructions that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

The app is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface that displays the current bitcoin price in various currencies. The user can select their preferred currency from a list of available options, such as USD, EUR, GBP, and more. The app will then retrieve the latest bitcoin price from the API and convert it to the selected currency.

Flutter is a popular open-source framework for building high-performance mobile applications that work on both iOS and Android platforms. It provides a rich set of widgets and tools that enable developers to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces quickly.

Overall, a bitcoin ticker app built using Flutter and an API is a valuable tool for anyone interested in tracking the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It provides real-time updates and historical data that can help users make informed decisions about their investments.
